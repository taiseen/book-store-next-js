## Book Store

- yarn create next-app
- yarn add @heroicons/react
- yarn add react-toastify

Learning Notes:

`State` ==> is a private data for a component...
`Props` ==> is a way to talk between two or more components...

But using `Context API` for information sharing between pages/components at global level

File & Folder Structure...
Layout - use for structure & styling...
Page - use for content... 

Using Context API with NextJs layout system...
Centralized Routing System...

```
